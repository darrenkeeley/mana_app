### MTG: Optimal Land Counts for Consistent Land Drops

Magic the Gathering = MTG

This app calculates (through simulation) the probabilities of not missing any land drops by turns 1 through 5. It supports multicolor decks, meaning one can calculate the probability of having 2 black mana by turn 2 in a multicolor deck. Mulligans are automatic following the rules laid out in the Channel Fireball article that this simulation is based on.
